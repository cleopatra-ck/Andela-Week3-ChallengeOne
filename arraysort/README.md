ArraySort

Given an array containing numbers and one character strings, write a function that takes the array and returns an object with property names evens, odds, and chars. The value for evens is an array of sorted even numbers and odds is an array of sorted odd numbers and chars is an array of sorted character strings. for example

arraySort([2,0,6,5,1,7,’z’,’a’])

returns {‘evens’: [0,2,6], odds: [1,5,7], chars:[‘a’,’z’]}
